            The annual <Link>Maumee Summer Fair</Link> is held each August on
            beautifully tree-lined streets in the historic uptown district of
            Maumee, Ohio. In addition to 150 arts &amp; crafts booths, we have a
            popular Kidâ€™s Zone featuring bounce houses and inflatables,
            caricature artist and face painting, a classic car show, and family
            entertainment throughout the day on Saturday.
            <br />
            <br />
            On Friday &amp; Saturday evening we have regional bands rocking the
            night for the 21-and-older crowd in the Beer Garden adjacent to the
            Taste of Maumee food vendors. Join us for a fun-filled weekend in
            uptown Maumee. Presented by the Maumee Uptown Business Association.
