          <h2>Identical Suns</h2>
          <h4>Saturday 3:15pm - 4:00pm</h4>
          <p>
            Identical Suns is an act consisting of members from California and
            Ohio. This band consists of many years of musical experience ranging
            from rock to classical music.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2015, the band released their self-titled debut on CD The only
            rule to the creation of the music is that there are no rules. Each
            song is an entity of it's own, and has no regard to any genre.
            <br />
            <br />
            Identical Suns released their follow up album just this year (2019)
            entitled "WEEK MINDED" and has an impressive 14 brand new original
            songs. They are excited to play some of those new songs this year on
            the MaumeePalooza stage.
            <br />
            <br />
            Identical Suns original music has played on various internet and
            radio stations through out the United States and a few other
            countries. Their music is available on all the streaming and
            download services.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is the 6th year that Identical Suns have played the
            MaumeePalooza stage. In addition to their appearances in Ohio, they
            have appeared in California and have also played on Stage-It, a live
            performance website.

          <h2>Reaganomics</h2>
          <h4>Saturday 8:30pm - MIDNIGHT</h4>
          <p>
            If rock music of the seventies was a statement of excess and
            overproduction, eighties rock only furthered those excesses. The
            best example of this musical trend was eighties New Wave, which was
            essentially modernized seventies Disco. New Wave, however,
            encompassed a wider range than the dance music that proceeded it.
            The Fixx and Duran Duran were prime examples of groups that had wide
            appeal and received substantial airplay on MTV.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Reaganomics are the midwest's most exciting 80's dance and party
            band. Based in Columbus, Ohio, The Reaganomics have become the
            area's most electrifying eighties show. With the release of their
            latest CD, "Ten", The Reaganomics have truly become the "must-see"
            act in the region.
